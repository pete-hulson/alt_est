# Abstract 

Integrated assessment models include multiple types of data, and their statistical leverage depends on sample sizes and variances that are assigned by the analyst.
There is a long history of standardizing survey and fishery catch data to estimate abundance indices and associated variance, but surprisingly little research to standardize compositional data to estimate input-sample-sizes.
Here we extend this research along three lines: (1) we expand an existing bootstrap estimator to compute an input-sample-size based on resampling individual lengths, age-length specimen samples, and survey hauls, and estimate the relative variance associated with each stage; (2) we compare these bootstrap types with a model-based estimate of input-sample-size; and (3) we compare assessment model outcomes using these alternative input-sample-size estimators.
Results show that bootstrapping only hauls results in an average input-sample-size for ages of X1 and for lengths of Y1, while bootstrapping hauls, specimens, and length records substantially reduces this to X2 and Y2 [or some other sentence summarizing patterns across Bootstrap Types].
Also, [add sentence about patterns in input-sample-size by species type and/or life-history].
Similarly, existing model-based estimators for input-sample-size are typically higher than the full bootstrap estimator, perhaps because the model-based estimator does not propagate imprecision from age-length specimens used to create an age-length key.
Finally, alternative input sample-size estimators have large/small impacts on a real-world assessment model for Gulf of Alaska Pacific cod.
We conclude by suggesting avenues for future research to compare bootstrap and model-based estimators of input-sample-size, and also emphasize examples of how this information can be used to optimize survey operations for use in fisheries management.
